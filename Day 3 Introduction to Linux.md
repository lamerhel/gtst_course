Linux is a kernel.
**What is kernel**?
Kernel is a code or program that used to meet your software and Hardware. And allocate some resources.
It provides essential services and functionalities, including:
* 1. **Process Management**: The kernel manages processes, which are running instances of programs, allocating resources and scheduling their execution on the CPU.
    
2. **Memory Management**: It manages system memory, allocating memory to processes, and handling memory protection to prevent unauthorized access.
    
3. **Device Management**: The kernel controls hardware devices such as disks, network interfaces, and input/output devices, allowing software to communicate with them.
    
4. **Filesystem Management**: It provides an interface for accessing and manipulating files and directories on storage devices.
    
5. **Security**: The kernel enforces security policies and access controls to protect the system and its resources from unauthorized access and malicious software.
    
6. **System Calls**: It provides system calls, which are interfaces for applications to request services from the kernel, such as opening files, creating processes, or performing I/O operations.
### History of Linux
In 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer. which was chosen mainly because of Thompson's familiarity with the system from his hobby work on it. BUT IT WASN’T CHEAP AND OPEN-SOURCE
 Then Person called “LINUS TORVALDS” Created the Linux kernel. And posted it online to make it open-source.
 Richard Stallman announced the GNU project(often used to refer to the collection of free software developed by the GNU project, as well as the broader philosophy of software freedom advocated by the Free Software Foundation) in 1983 and cofounded the Free Software Foundation in 1985.GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX OS, But it was just software replacement not full OS {Examples: Bash,tar,emacs…} .So GNU + LINUX will give the GNU/Linux OS.
The GNU Linux project was started to create a Unix-like operating system created with source code that could be copied, modified, and redistributed.
### What is Shell?
A shell is a command-line interpreter that provides an interface for users to interact with the operating system by executing commands and scripts. It is a crucial component of Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, as well as other systems such as macOS.

The shell interprets user input and executes commands, allowing users to perform various tasks, such as managing files, running programs, and configuring system settings. In addition to interactive use, shells are also used to write shell scripts, which are sequences of commands and control structures that can be executed as a single unit.
**Types of shell**
1. SH
2. BASH
3. ZSH
4. FISH
Linux's shell is terminal
Window's shell is cmd and PowerShell (updated form)
### Operating system
An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the computer. It handles tasks such as managing memory, running programs, handling input/output devices, and providing security.
    

OS contains:
A. Kernel
B. Software
C. Desktop environment
D. File extensions
E. Window manager
