## The decline Zagwe dynasity
The Zagwe Dynasty, which ruled parts of Ethiopia, came to an end due to a combination of internal and external pressures:

### Internal Problems of Royal Succession:

- The Zagwe Dynasty faced issues related to the succession of the throne, which led to instability within the ruling family and the state.

### Opposition from Descendants of Aksumite Rulers:

- Groups who claimed descent from the ancient rulers of the Aksumite Empire opposed the Zagwe rulers. These groups believed that the Zagwe kings were "illegitimate rulers."

### The Legend of the Queen of Sheba:

- The opposition's claims were based on the legend of the Queen of Sheba, which was documented in the "Kebra Nagast" (Glory of Kings).
- The "Kebra Nagast" is a work that was translated from Coptic to Arabic and then into Ge'ez. It narrates the story of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon, claiming that their descendants, known as the "Solomonic" Dynasty, ruled the Aksumite state.

### Usurpation by the Zagwe:

- According to the legend, the Solomonic Dynasty ruled until the Zagwe usurped power. This historical narrative fueled the opposition to the Zagwe rulers.

### Rise of Yekuno-Amlak:

- **Yekuno-Amlak (r. 1270-1285)**:
    - He claimed to be a descendant of the last Aksumite king, Dilna’od.
    - With the help of the ecclesiastical hierarchy (religious leaders), he organized his forces to challenge the Zagwe rule.

### Battle and Transition of Power:

- **Final Battle**:
    - Yekuno-Amlak engaged the last king of the Zagwe Dynasty, Yetbarek, in battle.
    - The battle took place in Gaynt, where Yetbarek was killed.

### Restoration of the Solomonic Dynasty:

- After defeating Yetbarek, Yekuno-Amlak proclaimed the "restoration" of the Solomonic Dynasty, asserting that the legitimate ruling line had been reestablished.
- This marked the end of the Zagwe Dynasty and the beginning of the Solomonic rule, which claimed to be the rightful continuation of the ancient Aksumite line.

### Significance:

- This transition underscored the importance of lineage and legitimacy in Ethiopian royal politics.
- The narrative of Solomonic descent provided a powerful ideological basis for Yekuno-Amlak's rule and subsequent Solomonic rulers.
- The ecclesiastical support Yekuno-Amlak received highlights the crucial role of religious institutions in legitimizing and supporting political power in the region.

**"Usurped power"** means to take control of a position of power, authority, or governance by force or without legal right. In the context of the Zagwe Dynasty, it implies that the Zagwe rulers took over the throne from the previous rulers (the Solomonic Dynasty) in a way that was considered illegitimate or unlawful by those who believed in the rightful lineage of the Solomonic Dynasty.

A descendant is a person who is related to someone who lived in the past, often a family member from an earlier generation. Descendants are the offspring of ancestors, such as children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on. For example, a descendant of a king would be that king's child, grandchild, or any subsequent generation down the family line.
