# Introduction to Networking

- A network consists of two or more entities or objects sharing resources and information.
- A computer network consists of two or more computing devices connected to each other to share resources and information.
- The network becomes a powerful tool when computers communicate and share resources with other computers on the same network or entirely distinct networks.
- Computers on a network can act as a client(a device that requests and receives services or resources from a server computer) or a server(provides services or resources to clients upon request and have higher RAM,CPU and STORAGE and also have their own operating system).
- A server rack is a specialized enclosure or frame designed to house multiple servers, networking equipment, and other computing hardware in a compact and organized manner.
**Need of Network**
- Enhance communication.
- Share resources.
- Facilitate centralized management
- Internet
### Classification of network
1. Classification by network geography
- Networks are frequently classified according to the geographical boundaries spanned by the network itself.
- LAN, WAN, and MAN are the basic types of classification, of which LAN and WAN are frequently used
1. **Local Area Network (LAN)**: LANs cover a small geographical area, typically within a single building or campus. They are commonly used in offices, schools, and homes to connect devices like computers, printers, and servers. LANs are inexpensive to install and also provide higher speeds
    
2. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: WANs cover a larger geographical area, often spanning cities, countries, or even continents. They connect multiple LANs and other types of networks together, enabling communication over long distances. The internet itself is the largest example of a WAN.
    
3. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: MANs cover an intermediate geographical area between LANs and WANs, typically encompassing a city or metropolitan area. They provide high-speed connectivity for businesses, organizations, and municipal services within the same geographic region.

### Classification by component role

- Networks can also be classified according to the roles that the networked computers play in the networkâ€™s operation.
- Peer-to-peer, server-based, and client-based are the types of roles into which networks are classified.
Peer to peer 
- In a peer-to-peer network, all computers are considered equal.
- Each computer controls its own information and is capable of functioning as either a client or a server depending upon the requirement.
- Peer-to-peer networks are cheap and easy to install.
- They are popular as home networks and for use in small companies.
- Most operating systems come with built-in peer-to-peer networking capability.
- The maximum number of peers that can operate on a peer-to-peer network is ten.
- Each peer shares resources and allows others open access to them.
