# The Linux file hierarchy 
The Linux file hierarchy refers to the organization and structure of files and directories in a Linux system. It defines where different types of files and directories are located, making it easier for users and applications to find and access them. 

System files 
System files are files used by the system software(OS)
**Window**: system files appear 
**Linux**: System files appear under the root directory (/)under the local disk C:
Here's a brief overview of the main directories in the Linux file hierarchy:

1. **`/` (Root Directory)**:
    
    - The root directory is the top-level directory in the Linux file system hierarchy.
    - All other directories and files are located under the root directory.
    - It contains essential system files and directories necessary for the operation of the system.
2. **`/bin` (Binaries)**:
    
    - This directory contains essential executable binaries (programs) that are required for system booting and repair. Available in single-user mode. Example: cat, ls, cp, pwd
3. **`/boot` (Boot Loader Files)**:
    
    - Contains boot loader files, kernel images, and other files required for system booting.
    - It typically contains the following types of files:

1. **Bootloader Configuration Files**: Configuration files for bootloaders such as GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) are stored here. These files specify the location of the kernel and the initial RAM disk (initramfs) required for booting.
    
2. **Kernel Images**: The actual kernel image files (`vmlinuz`) are stored in this directory. The kernel is the core component of the operating system responsible for managing hardware resources and providing essential services.
    
3. **Initramfs (Initial RAM File System)**: The initramfs is an initial filesystem loaded into memory during the boot process before the actual root filesystem is mounted. It contains essential drivers and utilities needed to initialize hardware and prepare the system for booting.
    
4. **Bootloader Stage Files**: Some bootloaders store their stage files or other necessary components in the `/boot` directory. These files are responsible for loading the kernel and initiating the boot process.
    

By storing these critical files in a separate directory (`/boot`), it helps ensure that they are easily accessible and isolated from other parts of the filesystem. This separation also simplifies system maintenance and troubleshooting, as the boot-related files can be managed independently.

4. **`/dev` (Device Files)**:
    
    - Contains device files representing devices attached to the system, such as hard drives, USB drives, etc.
5. **`/etc` (Configuration Files)**:
    
    - Contains system-wide configuration files for various applications and services.
    - This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.
    
6. **`/home` (Home Directories)**:
    
    - Contains user home directories where users store their personal files and configurations. Example: /home/hermela , /home/rexder  
7. **`/lib` (Libraries)**:
    
    - Contains shared libraries needed by the essential binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
8. **`/mnt` (Mount Point)**:
    
    - Typically used as a temporary mount point for mounting external storage devices like USB drives.
    - The difference between /mnt and /dev
     A. **/mnt (Mount Point)**:
    
    - The `/mnt` directory is used as a standard location for temporarily mounting external storage devices, network shares, or other filesystems.
    - When you want to access files on a USB drive, a network share, or any other external storage device, you typically mount it under the `/mnt` directory.
    - It is a convention for users to manually mount filesystems to `/mnt` when needed, although many Linux distributions may use other directories for this purpose as well.
     B.**/dev (Device Files)**:
    
    - The `/dev` directory contains special device files that represent devices attached to the system, such as hard drives, USB drives, CD-ROM drives, serial ports, and more.
    - These device files allow user programs and the operating system to communicate with and access hardware devices in a standardized way.
    - `/dev` is not intended for manual mounting of filesystems; instead, it provides access to device drivers and interfaces for system components.
    -
9.**`/opt` (Optional Packages)**:
    
    - Contains optional software packages that are not part of the default installation.
10. **`/proc` (Process Information)**:
    
    - Contains virtual files that provide information about system processes and kernel parameters.
11. **`/root` (Root User Home Directory)**:
    
    - Home directory for the root user.
12. **`/sbin` (System Binaries)**:
    
    - Contains essential system administration binaries.
13. **`/tmp` (Temporary Files)**:
    
    - Used for storing temporary files that are only needed for a short period of time.
14. **`/usr` (User Programs and Data)**:
    
    - Contains user-accessible programs, libraries, documentation, and other data.
15. **`/var` (Variable Data)**:
    
    - Contains variable data files such as logs, spool files, and temporary files.

This is just a brief overview, and there are many more directories in the Linux file hierarchy, each serving specific purposes in the operation of the system.

What is the difference between the root directory(/) and root?
1. **/** (Root Directory):
    
    - The "/" represents the root directory of the file system hierarchy.
    - It is the starting point of the file system, from which all other directories and files are organized.
    - It is analogous to the root of a tree, from which all branches (directories) and leaves (files) stem.
    - All directories and files are located under the root directory ("/").
    - The root directory is denoted by a single forward slash ("/").
2. **root (Superuser)**:
    
    - "root" is the username for the superuser or system administrator in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.
    - The root user has the highest level of privileges and can perform any operation on the system, including modifying system files and executing administrative tasks.
    - Unlike regular users who have limited access to certain directories and files, the root user has unrestricted access to the entire file system.
    - The root user's home directory is typically located at "/root", which is separate from the root directory ("/").
