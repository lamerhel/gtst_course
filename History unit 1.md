### Historiography of Ethiopia and the Horn

#### Early Historiography

1. **Periplus of the Erythrean Sea**: Written in the first century A.D. by an anonymous author, it is the earliest known reference on the history of Ethiopia and the Horn.
2. **Christian Topography**: Composed by Cosmas Indicopleustes, a Greek sailor, in the sixth century A.D., it describes Aksum’s trade and military campaigns.

#### Medieval Ethiopian Sources

1. **Seventh Century Documents**: The earliest written Ethiopian material from this period was found in Abba Gerima monastery in Yeha.
2. **Thirteenth Century Manuscripts**: Discovered in Haiq Istifanos monastery, these manuscripts, primarily religious, provide insights into the country's past (lists of medieval kings and brief histories.)
3. **Hagiographies**: Written in Ge’ez, these enhance the prestige of saints but also include anecdotes on church and state developments and territorial conquests.
4. **Muslim Hagiographies**: Such as the account of Shaykh Ja’far Bukko of Gattira, offering insights into indigenous Islam and regional Muslim community contacts.

#### Chronicles

- **Fourteenth Century Onwards**: Chronicles written in Ge’ez, and later in Amharic, record the genealogy, military exploits, and piety of monarchs. They provide detailed chronological accounts but focus mainly on religious interpretations of events.
- Ethiopia had an indigenous tradition of history writing called chronicles. These chronicles, written in the ancient Ethiopian Ge'ez language, began in the fourteenth century and continued, sometimes in Amharic, into the early twentieth century. Monarchs or their successors typically commissioned court scribes or clergymen with clerical training and calligraphic skills to write these chronicles. The earliest surviving chronicle is the "Glorious Victories of Amde-Tsion," while the last is the "Chronicle of Abeto Iyasu and Empress Zewditu."

### Characteristics of Ethiopian Chronicles

1. **Content**:
    
    - Chronicles combine both legends and factual accounts.
    - They focus on the monarch's genealogy, upbringing, military exploits, piety, and statesmanship.
    - While rich in detail and maintaining a strong chronological framework, converting their relative chronology to absolute dates can be labor-intensive.
2. **Religious Focus**:
    
    - Chronicles primarily explain historical events in religious terms.
    - They offer minimal information on social and economic developments, even those near the palace.
3. **Quantification**:
    
    - Chronicles generally lack quantifiable data.

### Historical Value

Despite their limitations, chronicles, when used alongside other written documents like hagiographies and travel accounts by foreign observers, provide valuable insights. They help us understand:

- The character and lives of kings.
- The monarchs' preoccupations and relations with subordinate officials.
- The evolution of the Ethiopian state and society, albeit inadequately in some respects.

In summary, Ethiopian chronicles are essential historical documents that offer detailed and religiously framed narratives about the country's past, especially its monarchs, while other sources are needed to gain a fuller understanding of the broader societal context.

#### Arabic-Speaking Visitors

- **Tenth and Fourteenth Centuries**: Accounts by al-Masudi and Ibn Battuta describe the culture, language, and trade of the East African coast.
- **Sixteenth Century**: Shihab ad-Din's _Futuh al Habesha_ documents the conflict between the Christian kingdom and Muslim principalities, including Imam Ahmed ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi's conquests. Al-Haymi's account details a Yemeni delegation's visit to Fasiledes' court.

#### European Missionaries and Travelers

- **Sixteenth to Nineteenth Centuries**: Missionaries like Francisco Alvarez and travelers like James Bruce provided valuable information on religious, political, and social developments.
- **Hiob Ludolf (1624-1704)**: Founded Ethiopian studies in Europe with _Historia Aethiopica_.
- **August Dillman (Nineteenth Century)**: Published objective studies on ancient Ethiopian history.

#### Twentieth Century Ethiopian Historiography

1. **Early Twentieth Century Writers**:
    
    - **Aleqa Taye Gebre-Mariam, Aleqa Asme Giorgis, and Debtera Fisseha-Giorgis Abyezgi**: Criticized chroniclers for their adulatory tone and wrote on social justice, administrative reform, and history.
    - **Negadrases Afework Gebre-Iyesus and Gebre-Hiwot Baykedagn**: Contributed significantly with works on history, novels, and public administration.
    - **Blatten Geta Hiruy Wolde-Selassie**: Prolific writer with works on Ethiopian history and biographies.
2. **Post-Italian Occupation**:
    
    - **Tekle-Tsadik Mekuria**: Bridged pre-1935 writers and modern professional historians.
    - **Yilma Deressa**: Addressed the Oromo population movement and Christian-Muslim conflicts.
    - **Blatten Geta Mahteme-Selassie Wolde-Meskel**: Wrote on Ethiopia’s land tenure systems and taxation.
3. **Academic Discipline**:
    
    - **1960s**: The Department of History at Haile Selassie I University (HSIU) began producing BA theses, later adding MA and PhD programs.
    - **Institute of Ethiopian Studies (IES)**: Founded in 1963, it houses historians and publishes the _Journal of Ethiopian Studies_. Richard Pankhurst was a notable figure with extensive publications.

#### Historiography in the Horn of Africa

- **Post-Colonial Professionalization**: The independence of nations in the Horn led to a deeper interest in exploring pre-colonial civilizations. This involved critical use of oral data and insights from archaeology, anthropology, and linguistics.
- **European and North American Influence**: Institutions like SOAS and the University of Wisconsin-Madison played crucial roles in developing African historiography.
- **Francophone and African Scholars**: African universities trained scholars who contributed significantly despite political instability.
#### Further explanation
- The professionalization of history in other parts of the Horn of Africa is primarily a post-colonial development. After gaining independence, African nations exhibited a strong desire to explore their own histories, a response to the previous decades of education dominated by imperial narratives. This period saw an urgent need to reframe the historical record and uncover evidence of lost pre-colonial civilizations.

Decolonizing African historiography required new methods of investigation, which involved critically using oral histories and incorporating insights from archaeology, anthropology, and linguistics. Simultaneously, European scholars began to question the Euro-centric perspectives of earlier studies, leading to a more focused academic interest in African history. This shift in academic approach spread to North America by the 1960s.

Foundational research on African history was conducted at institutions like the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London and the Department of History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Both Anglophone and Francophone scholars have made significant contributions to the field.

Importantly, the development of African historiography has not been solely driven by European interests. African universities, despite facing political instability and civil wars, have trained numerous scholars. Many of these scholars have pursued further education abroad and have published extensively on various aspects of the region’s history.

### Summary

The historiography of Ethiopia and the Horn has evolved significantly over the past century, transitioning from early chronicles and religious manuscripts to modern academic research. This evolution has involved contributions from various sources, including Ethiopian chroniclers, European missionaries and travelers, and modern scholars from Africa and abroad. The development of academic history departments and research institutes has further professionalized the study of the region's history.


### 1.4. The Geographical Context

The term "Ethiopia and the Horn" refers to Northeast Africa, comprising Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. The region's geography is dominated by mountains formed through the Great Rift Valley, which runs from Syria to Mozambique, marking the separation of the African and Arabian tectonic plates. This creates a diverse terrain of highlands, lowlands, semi-deserts, deserts, and tropical forests, leading to variations in climate, vegetation, soil, and settlement patterns.

#### Physical and Human Geography

- **Diversity**: The region is home to diverse languages, religions, dwellings, and economic activities. Despite these differences, historical interactions among the region's peoples have created shared cultural and historical aspects.
- **Geographical Factors**: Location, landforms, resource endowment, climate, and drainage systems have significantly influenced human activities and history, impacting the movement of people and goods.

#### Spatial Location

- **Connections**: The region lies between the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Indian Ocean to the east and Sudan and Kenya to the west. Historically, the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden connected Northeast Africa to the Eastern Mediterranean, Near and Middle East, India, and the Far East. The Indian Ocean also facilitated connections with these regions.

#### Drainage Systems

- **Nile River**: The White Nile flows from Uganda to Sudan, meeting the Blue Nile (Abay) from Lake Tana, and drains into the Mediterranean Sea through Egypt.
- **Awash River System**: Confined to Ethiopia, it links Central Ethiopian highlands with the Danakil Depression lowlands.
- **Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes**: A self-contained basin with lakes from Lake Ziway to Lake Turkana on the Ethio-Kenyan border.
- **Gibe/Omo-Gojeb River System**: Connects southern Ethiopia to northern Kenya's semi-desert lowlands.
- **Shebele and Genale/Jubba Rivers**: Flow from the Eastern highlands toward Somalia and the Indian Ocean, with Genale reaching the ocean and Shebele disappearing inland.

These drainage systems have historically facilitated movement, exchange of goods and ideas, and cultural interactions, significantly impacting the region's history and livelihoods.

#### Environmental Zones

1. **Eastern Lowlands**:
    
    - Includes the northeastern Eritrean coast, Danakil Depression, lower Awash valley, Ogaden, and parts of Djibouti, Hararghe, Bale, Borana, Sidamo, and Somalia.
    - Characterized by hot, dry conditions, shrub and bush vegetation, and little seasonal climate variation.
2. **Highland Massif**:
    
    - Extends from northern Eritrea to southern Ethiopia, with the Rift Valley dividing its eastern (Arsi, Bale, Hararghe plateau) and western parts.
    - Features complex mountains, deep valleys, and extensive plateaus.
3. **Western Lowlands**:
    
    - Located on the plateau's western periphery and Sudan's borderlands, historically thickly forested, especially along the Nile and its tributaries.

#### Linguistic and Ethnic Connections

Despite varied environments, the region's countries share linguistic and ethnic ties, partly due to historical population movements. These interactions have created complex settlement patterns and weakened ethnic dividing lines, making linguistic and cultural affinities significant for grouping populations.

### Summary

Ethiopia and the Horn's geography has shaped its history and societies through diverse terrains, climate, and natural resources, facilitating interactions and cultural exchanges. Understanding the geographical context helps in comprehending the historical development and societal organization in the region.
