program  refers to the set of instructions or statements written in a programming language to perform a specific task or achieve a particular goal.
The main difference between a compiler and an interpreter lies in how they process and execute code written in a programming language:

1. **Compiler**:
    
    - A compiler translates the entire source code of a program written in a high-level programming language into machine code (also known as object code) or another form that can be directly executed by the computer's hardware.
    - The compilation process typically involves several stages, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
    - Once the compilation process is complete, the resulting compiled code is saved as an executable file, which can be executed independently of the original source code.
    - Compiled programs tend to execute faster than interpreted programs because the compilation process optimizes the code for the target platform.
    - Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, and Swift.
2. **Interpreter**:
    
    - An interpreter reads the source code of a program written in a high-level programming language line by line and executes it directly without the need for a separate compilation step.
    - The interpreter translates each statement or line of code into machine code or intermediate code and executes it immediately.
    - Interpreted programs are often executed directly from the source code or from an intermediate representation, without generating a separate executable file.
    - Interpreted programs may have slower execution speeds compared to compiled programs because the interpretation process incurs overhead at runtime.
    - Examples of interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.
**syntax** refers to the set of rules that define the structure and composition of valid statements or expressions. It dictates how symbols, keywords, and other elements should be arranged to form meaningful and executable code.
**Command-line text editors on Linux allow users to edit text directly within the terminal, while graphical text editors provide a visual interface for editing text files.**

  

In Linux, file and directory permissions are divided into three categories: user, group, and others. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. **User**: The "user" category refers to the owner of the file or directory. It represents the permissions granted to the individual user who owns the file or directory. The user permissions dictate what actions the owner of the file or directory can perform.
    
2. **Group**: The "group" category refers to a specific group of users that have been assigned to the file or directory. Group permissions specify the access rights granted to all users who are members of that particular group. Group permissions are useful for allowing multiple users to access the same files while still maintaining some level of control over who can modify them.
    
3. **Others**: The "others" category refers to all users who are neither the owner of the file nor members of the group associated with the file. These are essentially everyone else who has access to the system. Others permissions define the access rights granted to all other users on the system who are not the owner or part of the group.
## Difference b/n encryption and encoding
1. **Purpose**:
    
    - **Encoding**: Ensures data is in a proper format for use by different systems.
    - **Encryption**: Protects data from unauthorized access and ensures confidentiality.
2. **Functionality**:
    
    - **Encoding**: Uses specific schemes (e.g., Base64, UTF-8) to transform data.
    - **Encryption**: Uses cryptographic algorithms and keys to secure data.
3. **Reversibility**:
    
    - **Encoding**: Easily reversible through decoding.
    - **Encryption**: Reversible only with the correct decryption key.
4. **Security**:
    
    - **Encoding**: Not secure; designed for compatibility and usability.
    - **Encryption**: Secure; designed to protect data from unauthorized access.
5. **Examples**:
    
    - **Encoding**: Base64, UTF-8, URL encoding.
    - **Encryption**: AES, RSA, TLS/SSL.
