## peer to peer


- In a peer-to-peer network, all computers are considered equal.
- Each computer controls its own information and is capable of functioning as either a client or a server depending upon the requirement.
- Peer-to-peer networks are cheap and easy to install.
- They are popular as home networks and for use in small companies.
- Most operating systems come with built-in peer-to-peer networking capability.
- The maximum number of peers that can operate on a peer-to-peer network is ten.
- Each peer shares resources and allows others open access to them.
## Server based

- A server-based network offers centralized control and is designed for secure operations.
- In a server-based network, a dedicated server controls the network.
- A dedicated server is one that services the network by storing data, applications, resources, and also provides access to resources required by the client.
## Client based

- Client-based network servers process requests from clients and return just the results.
- These networks take advantage of the powerful processing capabilities of both the client and the server.
# Internet protocol address

- IP (Internet Protocol) is a Network Layer Protocol.
- A way to identify machines on a network
- A unique identifier
**usage** 
- Used to connect to another computer or network.
- Allows transfers of files and e-mail
- Identify a device
**Types**
1. **IPv4**:
    
    - Uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
    - Limited address space, which has led to IPv4 address exhaustion, as the number of internet-connected devices has grown.
    - Still widely used but facing scarcity issues, leading to the adoption of IPv6.
    - **

    - To make the IP address easier to use, the address is usually written as four decimal numbers separated by periods. 
    - This way of writing the address is called the dotted decimal format.
    - IP generated by DHCP or Manually

1. **IPv6**:
    
    - Uses 128-bit addresses, providing an astronomically larger address space compared to IPv4.
    - Designed to address the limitations of IPv4 and support the growing number of internet-connected devices.
    - Offers improved security, mobility, and performance over IPv4.
    - While adoption has been slower compared to IPv4, it's becoming increasingly prevalent, especially as IPv4 addresses become scarcer.
### IP structure
- IP addresses consist of four sections (192.168.45.1)
- Each section is 8 bits long
- Each section can range from 0 to 255
- When you connect to some network an IP address will be generated and given(automatically by DHCP or static way).

- Every IP address has two parts: 
     1. Network: to identify the network( የእናንተ,የጎረቤት)
     2. Host: identify the user(ስልክ,PC)
- The first(1) host address is called GATEWAY ADDRESS.
